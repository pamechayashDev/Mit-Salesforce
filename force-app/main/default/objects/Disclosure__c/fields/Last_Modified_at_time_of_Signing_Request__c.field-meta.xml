    <description>This field holds the Disclosures Last Modified Date/Time at the time Signing Envelope was requested, so that we are able to tell if Disclosure has been modified since last request when Disclosure is in a Draft status. If Disclosure has been changed then we will need to update the doc on DocuSign&apos;s envelope if not we can leave as is.</description>
